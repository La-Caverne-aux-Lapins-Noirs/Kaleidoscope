# Kaleidoscope

An old website developped by Pentacle Technologie now used as support for cracking and hacking practical work.
It is full of holes: don't run it on your server!

Kaleidoscope is a youtube clone made for a company that was called Deep Side Center years ago.

The current version use a flash video player. It should be updated to replace it with a video markup later, in order to work on modern browser.
